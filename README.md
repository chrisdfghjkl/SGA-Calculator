#### Description
Epicodus independent project for Test Driven Development unit. The application determines a user's age based on the solar years of the following planets:
* Mercury (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years)
* Venus (A Venus year is .62 Earth years)
* Mars (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years)
* Jupiter (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years)

The application also determines the number of years a user has left to live on each planet by using Earth's global life expectancy (72.6) to calculate the life expectancy on each of the above planets. If a user has already surpassed the life expectancy of said planet, the application returns the number of years they have lived past the life expectancy.

This application does not include user interface.
